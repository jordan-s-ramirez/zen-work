Using the Spotify API, it is possible to create a visual analyzer that allows users to see insights and statistics about their past 50 songs. This can include information such as the most common artist, genre, or decade of the songs in their history. The visual analyzer can also display this data in a graphical format, such as a pie chart or bar graph, making it easy for users to understand and interpret the data. This can be a useful tool for music lovers who want to learn more about their listening habits and discover new music based on their past listening history. Additionally, the visual analyzer can be customized to allow users to filter their song history by specific criteria, such as a specific time period or genre, to get a more detailed understanding of their music preferences.\n
## Results \n
As a developer, I have found that using React Native and Material-UI design principles has been extremely helpful in creating effective data visualizations. React Native allows me to build fast and responsive user interfaces, while Material-UI provides a consistent and intuitive design language. By combining these two tools, I am able to create visually appealing and user-friendly data visualizations that effectively communicate information to the user.\n

## Limitations\n
Although the spotify Api is really good and has a lot of functions, they were still limited. For instance, when trying to analyize the users past 50 songs, there wasn't an API call for the song genre. One way around this problem was using the Artists' set genre that they have on their profile page. This method limited since most Artists release differnt types of genres, this could represent the data.\n
